## Skin Conductance Data Features

This is a scratchpad for trying to describe skin
conductance patterns numerically. Don't laugh - 
there's probably some obvious maths solution 
that I never learned at school. I'm starting with things 
based on standard deviation because when I trained a 
learning algorithm on a bunch of descriptives it turned 
out it was mostly relying on that.
